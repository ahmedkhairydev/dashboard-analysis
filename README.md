## Angular Version

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

## Development server

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the project. The project URL will be https://ahmedkhairydev.github.io/dashboard-analysis/

## Problems during the implementation

- When a user click upon a point of the chart, there's an issue that the application can't navigate via ** Angular Routing ** navigate method.

## Decisions

- I decided to use Angular Framework because I'm using it continuously.
- I decided using the [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/) because I used it recently and it's powerful.
- I decided to don't write any unit-test cases because I don't good at them.
